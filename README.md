It appears the FNG model is performing significantly worse than the closing price model. I believe this is because the closing price model uses previous prices, which is directly related to the next price. However, the FNG model doesn't really have anything to do with the magnitude of the price, rather the change in price. 

Therefore, the FNG model is likely a much better indicator at predicting the change in price.
